## Our Vision
To provide a forum for collaboration for software engineers across government
*	To learn and to teach
*	To share ideas
*	To have some fun

Our vision helps us fullfil our  [Objectives](/objectives).

## How are we doing this
* Engaging with the community on [UK Government Digital Slack](https://ukgovernmentdigital.slack.com/) - in the #software-development channel
*	Running monthly virtual lean coffee sessions 
*	Developing our GitHub repo
*	Looking to run more themed events 
*	Hosting virtual software engineering meetups
*	We have a small facilitation group that is doing some of the initial setup

## Do you want to help facilitate the group ?
Drop an email to [Andy Poole](mailto:Andy.Poole@ukho.gov.uk) or [David Heath](mailto:david.heath@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) or [Shaun Hare](mailto:shaun.hare@dvsa.gov.uk) and one of us can add you to the facilitators group
